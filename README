The subdirectories in this folder contain all the data and code to generate the figures for the phenology paradox manuscript. 

Each directory contains a README file that provides a summary of the figure and instructions to create the figure using R code.

Some of the folders provide the precomputed data required for the figures. In those folders, there will be a Simulation or an Analysis subdirectory that provides additional code to carry out simulations or analyses to generate the data used for the figure. 

Some of the simulated data or results of analyses will require additional formatting to match the requirements of the script that generates the figure. The README file again provides additional details, which typically involve sorting uniquely to keep only one header line, reformatting to a tab-separated text vs. csv file, or removing strings such as 'NA' or '_'.

To generate the datasets used for publication, some of the simulations and analyses will take several days to complete on standard desktop computers. Unless the same number of replicates or the same seeds are used, some deviations from the published figures can be expected, although the overall results should not differ from those published, even if different seeds are used when the number of replicates is sufficient. 

To run the code provided, the following R libraries and their dependencies will be needed for one or more figures, simulations, or analyses:

bayesplot
cmdstanr
cowplot
dplyr
elevatr
fitdistrplus
ggplot2
here
latex2exp
magick
ncdf4
phest from github.com/willpearse/phest
posterior
purrr
quantreg
raster
readr
rgdal
ridigbio

sp
stringr
tibble
tidyr
tidyverse
viridis

These can be obtained at CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/) through the standard install.packages R command except for phest, for which a URL is provided above.
