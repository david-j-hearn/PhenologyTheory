This figure addresses the issue of model identifiability by comparing MLE to Bayesian GP inferences. 

Model identifiability is an issue for MLE. Including a prior as a penalizer / regularizer ameliorates this issue.

The figure was initially made in two parts: p1 and p2. These were joined and further refined using InkScape.

To run the code that generates these parts, cowplot and ggplot2 are required packages.

To make the two parts, run the following from an R terminal:

source("makeFig6.R")

This will produce two pdf files with p1 and p2 as part of the file name.

The data used to make these plots are contained in the results.I.txt file. 

If one wishes to regenerate these simulation results, follow the README file in the Simulation directory.
