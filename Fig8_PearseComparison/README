The goal is the explore the inference of extremes using Pearse and the proposed method. Populations of three sizes were simulated and were sampled at various sample sizes. 
To make the plot, run the following in an R terminal:

pdf("Fig8_PearseComparison.pdf")
source("makeFig8.PearseComparison.R")
dev.off()

The data used to generate the figure are in the "results.txt" file. These data are summaries of multiple simulation replicates.

If you wish to regenerate these simulation data, follow the README file in the Simulation subdirectory.
