To generate the simlulation data to analyze the Pearse et al estimator, run the runAnalysis.sh script. 
This script calls several processes in parallel. 

After the script finishes concatenate all the results from the output.P* files into a single file, sort it, and remove all but one header line.

If your machine does not have at least 20 CPU available, edit the runAnalysis.sh file and reduce the number of processes run by commenting out lines as necessary.

Alternatively, to run a single process, run the following from an R terminal:

source("run_PearseAnalysis.R")
run_PearseAnalysis(replicates=100, outputFile="output.P.txt")

This will generate output in an output file called output.P.txt
