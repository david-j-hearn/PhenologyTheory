To make the figure that compares the onset inference error rate as a function of duration between Bayesian GP and QR, run the following from the R terminal prompt:

source("makeFig10_QRvBayesianGP.R")

The resulting file Fig10.quantileRegressionComparison.pdf provides a summary of the data in results.firstPass.txt. 

To regenerate similar data, follow the README in the Simulation subdirectory. Run at least 5000 replicates for each Scenario, or comment out the line 'data = data[1:5000, ]' in the makeFig10_QRvBayesianGP.R file. Concatenate the output files, sort reverse unique to remove all but one header line.
