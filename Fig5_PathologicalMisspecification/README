Goal of this figure is to illustrate how well the GP does to fit the BB model in a case where there is not a shared variance between the onset and the duration / cessation distributions.  Doesn't do well when the observed distibution is highly asymmetrical.

This code requires: 

cmdstanr with stan
bayesplot
tidyverse
posterior
dplyr

Note that depending on the seed used, results may vary slightly

Refinements added using InkScape
