This figure investigates the relationship between the variance of the distribution of observed collection times, the variance in the onset and cessation, and the perception of duration. 

The conclusion is that variance of the distribution of observed collection times is not a valid proxy for duration. 

To make the figure, run the following from an R terminal prompt:

pdf("Fig13_VarianceVsDuration.pdf")
source("makeFig13.VarianceVsDuration.R")
dev.off()

Additional refinements were done manually using InkScape.
