# PhenologyTheory
Theory and Bayesian inference of phenological states from biocollection data

The folders and files within provide scripts and data needed to generate the figures for the manuscript: A unified theory and Bayesian framework for phenological inference from biocollection data:
Resolving paradoxes by considering phenophase duration. 

Within each folder, a README file describes how to use the R code to generate the figures. Some of the figures require simulation data. Precomputed simulation data are available in relevant folders, but if reviewers wish to recreate the simulated data, there are subfolders (Simulation, Analysis) that provide additional code to run the simulations.
